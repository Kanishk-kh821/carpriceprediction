Project Overview
The Car Price Prediction project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts the price of a car based on 12 parameters provided by the user. By leveraging a dataset consisting of 15,412 records of car sales, the model can provide an estimated price for a car with specific attributes. The goal is to assist users in determining a fair market value for their vehicles based on historical data.

Key Features
User Input Parameters: The model takes the following 12 parameters as input from the user:

car name
brand name 
model
vehicle age
km driven
seller type
fuel type
transmission type
mileage
engine
max power
seats
selling price

Dataset: The model uses a dataset with 15,412 entries, each representing a car sale. Each entry includes the car's details and the price at which it was sold.

Prediction Algorithm: A machine learning algorithm (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) is trained on the dataset to learn the relationship between car attributes and their sale prices.

Steps Involved
Data Collection: Gather a comprehensive dataset of car sales, including the 12 specified parameters and the final sale price.

Data Preprocessing:

Clean the dataset by handling missing values and outliers.
Encode categorical variables (e.g., brand , model, fuel type).
Normalize/scale numerical features (e.g., mileage, engine).
Model Training:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train the chosen machine learning algorithm on the training set.


User Interface: Develop a user-friendly interface (e.g., a web app) where users can input the 12 parameters and receive an estimated car price.

Outcome
The Car Price Prediction model provides users with an estimated market value for their cars based on current and historical data. This tool can be particularly useful for individuals looking to sell or buy a car, allowing them to make informed decisions based on data-driven insights.
